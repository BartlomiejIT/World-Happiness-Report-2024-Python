## Objective

This project analyzes the **World Happiness Report 2024** dataset to uncover trends and insights into global happiness. The analysis leverages multiple socio-economic indicators such as GDP per capita, social support, life expectancy, and more. Additionally, geographic data from **Natural Earth** is integrated to visualize spatial patterns of happiness across countries.

The primary objectives are to:
- Identify the key factors that influence national happiness.
- Visualize the distribution and trends of happiness scores both statistically and geographically.
- Provide actionable insights that may inform policies aimed at improving quality of life.

## Data Sources

- **World Happiness Report 2024**:  
  - Contains annual measurements of happiness metrics across countries.
  - Variables include: *Life Ladder*, *Log GDP per capita*, *Social support*, *Healthy life expectancy*, *Freedom to make life choices*, *Generosity*, *Perceptions of corruption*, etc.
  - Sourced from Kaggle or official reports.

- **Natural Earth Data**:  
  - Provides free vector and raster map data for global geographic boundaries.
  - Included files:
    - `ne_110m_admin_0_countries.shp`
    - `ne_110m_admin_0_countries.shx`
    - `ne_110m_admin_0_countries.dbf`
    - `ne_110m_admin_0_countries.prj`
    - `ne_110m_admin_0_countries.README.html`
  - These are used to create maps and spatial visualizations that overlay the happiness data on country boundaries.

## Tools and Libraries

- **Python** – The main programming language.
- **Pandas** – For data manipulation and cleaning.
- **GeoPandas** – To handle geospatial data.
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** – For creating static visualizations.
- **Jupyter Notebook** – For interactive analysis and documentation.
- *(Optional)* **Folium/Plotly** – For interactive map visualizations.

## Methodology

### Data Loading and Cleaning

- **Loading Data**:
  - Import the World Happiness dataset using `pandas.read_csv()`.
  - Load geographic data using `geopandas.read_file()` from the provided shapefiles.
  
- **Data Cleaning**:
  - Inspect the dataset for missing values, outliers, and inconsistent formatting.
  - Standardize country names/codes to enable proper merging between the happiness and geographic datasets.
  - Handle duplicates and perform necessary type conversions for analysis.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

- **Descriptive Statistics**:
  - Calculate summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation) for the key variables.
  - Visualize distributions using histograms, box plots, and density plots.
  
- **Correlation Analysis**:
  - Generate and visualize a correlation matrix using a heatmap.
  - Identify which variables are most strongly correlated with the happiness scores.

- **Trend Analysis**:
  - If data from multiple years is available, analyze trends over time.
  - Group data by regions to identify geographical patterns and regional differences in happiness.

### Geographical Mapping

- **Mapping Country Boundaries**:
  - Merge the cleaned happiness data with the Natural Earth geographic data.
  - Create choropleth maps to visualize happiness scores across countries.
  - Optionally, overlay other variables (e.g., GDP per capita) to explore multi-variable spatial patterns.
  
- **Interactive Mapping (Optional)**:
  - Use libraries such as Folium or Plotly for interactive map visualizations that allow users to explore the data dynamically.

## Detailed Analysis

The analysis is divided into several steps:

1. **Data Import and Preprocessing**:
   - Detailed examination of the dataset structure.
   - Cleaning steps including handling missing values and standardizing formats.
   
2. **Statistical Analysis**:
   - Compute summary statistics and generate visualizations (e.g., histograms, scatter plots, pair plots).
   - Perform regression analysis to identify significant predictors of happiness.

3. **Visualization**:
   - Use Matplotlib/Seaborn to generate static plots.
   - Create a series of choropleth maps using GeoPandas to illustrate geographical trends.
   
4. **Interpretation of Results**:
   - Discuss the observed correlations between economic, social, and institutional factors and happiness.
   - Highlight outlier countries and hypothesize potential causes.
   - Provide insights into how the data might inform public policy or future research.

## Results and Key Insights

- **Economic Factors**:  
  Higher GDP per capita is generally associated with higher happiness scores.

- **Social Support**:  
  Countries with robust social support systems tend to have improved overall happiness.

- **Health and Longevity**:  
  Longer, healthier lives correlate with increased happiness levels.

- **Geographical Trends**:  
  Regional patterns emerge, with Northern European countries often ranking among the happiest.

- **Institutional Trust**:  
  Lower perceptions of corruption and increased freedom to make life choices positively influence happiness.

## How to Run the Project

1. **Clone or Download the Repository**:  
   Ensure that all files (notebook, dataset, and geographic data) are in the project folder.

2. **Install Dependencies**:  
   Install the required Python libraries using pip:
   ```
   pip install pandas geopandas matplotlib seaborn jupyter
   ```
   *(Optional: If you plan to use interactive mapping libraries, also install folium or plotly.)*

3. **Run the Notebook**:  
   Open `World Happiness Report 2024.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook and run all cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis and visualizations.

## Future Work

- **Interactive Visualizations**:  
  Develop interactive maps and dashboards to allow non-technical users to explore the data dynamically.
  
- **Extended Time Series Analysis**:  
  Incorporate data from multiple years to more comprehensively analyze trends over time.
  
- **Advanced Statistical Modeling**:  
  Implement predictive models to forecast future happiness scores based on economic and social variables.
  
- **User Interface Development**:  
  Create a web-based interface (using Flask/Django) to make the analysis accessible to a broader audience.
